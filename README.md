# ZKResume: Privacy-Preserving Resume Verification with Zero Knowledge Proofs

## Project Description

ZKResume is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables secure and private verification of resumes using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). It ensures that job applicants can prove their credentials without revealing any sensitive personal or academic data.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize resume verification by making it:
- **Private**: No need to reveal full resume data to employers.
- **Trustless**: Powered by blockchain and ZKPs, eliminating the need for centralized authorities.
- **Decentralized**: Built on Ethereum-compatible blockchains with fully transparent verification mechanisms.

## Key Features

- 📄 **ZK-Proof Based Verification**: Submit encrypted resume hashes and ZKPs.
- 🔐 **Privacy-Preserving**: Prevents exposure of raw data, only proving authenticity.
- 👤 **User-Owned Identity**: Resume ownership and submission are tied to user wallets.
- 🧾 **Event Logs**: Transparent logging of submissions and verifications.
- ⚙️ **Owner-Based Admin Rights**: Only contract owner can verify resumes for authenticity.

## Future Scope

- ✅ Integration with decentralized identity (DID) standards.
- 🔁 Cross-chain interoperability.
- 🧠 AI-verified resume parsing and fraud detection.
- 📡 IPFS/Filecoin integration for fully decentralized resume hosting.
- 👨‍💼 Employer dashboard with permissioned access to proofs.
